src/
	app/                 # App shell and top-level pages (router entry, not-found)
	features/            # Feature modules (home, events, team, contact, blogs, upis)
		<feature>/
			components/      # Feature-specific UI pieces
			data/            # Feature-specific static data/models
			pages/           # Feature page components
	shared/              # Reusable cross-feature modules
		components/
